# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-16
**Feature**: specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - FIXED: Removed specific technology references
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - FIXED: Removed technical jargon
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - FIXED: Removed clarification markers and made assumptions explicit
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - FIXED: Removed technology-specific terms
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - ADDED: Created assumptions section

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - FIXED: Removed technology implementation details

## Notes

- All validation items now pass. Specification is ready for the next phase.
