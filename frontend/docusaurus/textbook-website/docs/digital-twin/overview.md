# The Digital Twin (Simulation)

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin in robotics is a virtual replica of a physical robot that exists in simulation. This digital representation allows for testing, validation, and development without risk to the physical system.

## Benefits of Simulation

- **Safe Testing**: Experiment with complex behaviors without damaging hardware
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduce the need for physical prototypes
- **Rapid Iteration**: Quickly test and refine algorithms
- **Environment Modeling**: Simulate various real-world conditions
