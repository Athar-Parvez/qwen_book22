# Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed to interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates on abstract data, Physical AI systems must understand and navigate the complexities of the real world, including dynamics, physics, and real-time constraints.

## Core Principles of Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is based on the principle that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. Key principles include:

- **Embodiment**: The physical form influences cognitive processes
- **Environment Interaction**: Learning through physical engagement with the world
- **Real-time Processing**: Making decisions under temporal constraints
- **Sensorimotor Integration**: Combining sensory input with motor output

## Applications in Robotics

Physical AI is essential for creating robots that can operate in unstructured environments. Applications include:

- Household robots that can navigate and manipulate objects
- Industrial robots that can adapt to variable conditions
- Service robots that can interact safely with humans
- Exploration robots for hazardous environments
