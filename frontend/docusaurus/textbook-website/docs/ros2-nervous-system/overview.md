# The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview of ROS 2

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) provides the communication infrastructure for robotic systems. It serves as the nervous system of a robot, enabling different components to communicate and coordinate effectively.

## Why ROS 2 Matters

ROS 2 offers several advantages for building robotic systems:

- **Distributed Architecture**: Components can run on different machines
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Support for time-critical operations
- **Security**: Built-in security features for safe deployment
- **Industry Adoption**: Widely adopted in both academia and industry
