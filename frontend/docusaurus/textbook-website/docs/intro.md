# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

This comprehensive textbook covers the cutting-edge field of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, combining perception, reasoning, and action in embodied systems. The book is structured into six main chapters that take you from fundamental concepts to capstone implementation.

## What You'll Learn

- **Embodied Intelligence**: How robots understand and interact with the physical world
- **ROS 2 Systems**: Building robust robotic communication networks
- **Simulation**: Creating digital twins for testing and development
- **AI Integration**: Implementing NVIDIA Isaac for intelligent robot behaviors
- **Vision-Language-Action**: Building multimodal AI systems for robotics
- **Capstone Project**: Developing an autonomous humanoid project from concept to reality

This textbook is designed for students, researchers, and engineers interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics.

## Getting Started

Each chapter includes theoretical concepts, practical examples, and hands-on exercises. You'll learn to develop intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in real-world environments.
