# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Modular Content Architecture
Every chapter and concept starts as modular content that can stand alone; Content must be self-contained, independently understandable, well-documented with clear learning objectives; Each module serves a clear educational purpose with practical applications

### 2. Technology Integration First
Every concept integrates with real technology implementations; Technologies covered include Docusaurus, FastAPI, ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, Qdrant, Neon Postgres; Support both theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation

### 3. Test-Driven Learning (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD applies to educational content: Learning objectives defined → Student assessments designed → Gaps identified → Then develop content; Red-Green-Refactor cycle adapted for content: Identify learning gap → Create content → Validate student comprehension

### 4. Simulation-First Approach
Before real hardware, all concepts are validated through simulation; This applies to both robotics concepts and software implementations; Ensures accessibility and reproducibility for students worldwide

### 5. Embodied Intelligence Focus
Bridge digital AI minds with physical robotic bodies; Emphasize the importance of sensorimotor integration; Focus on perception, planning, navigation and manipulation in real environments

### 6. Production-Ready Education
Educational content must translate directly to industry practices; Code examples follow production standards; Students develop skills equivalent to junior engineers in AI/robotics companies

## Technology Stack Requirements

Mandatory technologies include: Docusaurus for documentation interface, FastAPI for backend services, Python for primary implementations, OpenAI Agents SDK for AI integration, Qdrant Cloud for vector storage, Neon Serverless Postgres for metadata, ROS 2 for robotics middleware, NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation

## Development Workflow

Content development follows Spec-Kit Plus methodology; Each chapter has corresponding specification documents; Regular peer reviews by domain experts; Integration with RAG-based QA system for continuous improvement

## Governance

All content must comply with pedagogical principles outlined herein; Amendments require subject matter expert approval; Student feedback drives iterative improvements; Use specification documents as primary development guidance
